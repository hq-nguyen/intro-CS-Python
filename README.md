# MIT OCW 6.100L: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python

### Overview
Welcome to my solutions for the MIT OCW 6.100L course's problem sets! This course, "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python," is designed to teach the basics of programming and computational thinking. Throughout the course, I worked on different problem sets that helped me develop my skills in Python programming and problem-solving.

### Problem Sets

Hereâ€™s a list of the problem sets and their topics:

1. Problem Set 1: Introduction to Python basics (variables, conditionals, loops, and functions).
2. Problem Set 2: Working with strings, lists, and recursion.
3. Problem Set 3: Object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python.
4. Problem Set 4: Recursion and solving more complex problems.
5. Problem Set 5: Algorithms, sorting, searching, and understanding efficiency.
6. Problem Set 6: Data analysis, working with files, and handling larger datasets.

Each problem set folder contains:

- Problem Description (`psX.pdf` where X is the problem set number)
- My Python Solution (`psetX_solution.py`)
